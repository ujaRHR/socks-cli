### SOCKS-CLI

A minimal CLI tool to quickly connect to SOCKS4/SOCKS5 proxies with shorthand commands. Skip verbose configs, just run "bash connect.sh connect" and tunnel traffic instantly.

## Commands:
1. **Connect**: `bash connect.sh connect`
2. **Disconnect:** `bash connect.sh disconnect`
3. **Configure:** `bash connect.sh setup`

> You can use 'alias' on your machine to shorten the commands further.
